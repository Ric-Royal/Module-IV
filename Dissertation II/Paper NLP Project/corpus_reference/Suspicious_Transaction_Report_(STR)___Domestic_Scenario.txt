2.	Transaction Description Frequent interbank transfers were made to various accounts in different banks within a week, totaling $150,000.
3.	Suspicious Transaction The account was primarily used for receiving a monthly salary and occasional online purchases. The sudden flurry of interbank transfers is anomalous.
