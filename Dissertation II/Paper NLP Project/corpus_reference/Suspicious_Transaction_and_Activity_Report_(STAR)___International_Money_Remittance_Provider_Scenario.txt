Paragraph 2: Transaction and Activity Description A customer conducted a money remittance transaction of $15,000 to a beneficiary in a sanctioned jurisdiction. Additionally, the customer made multiple inquiries about the remittance process to other sanctioned jurisdictions.
Paragraph 3: Suspicious Transaction and Activity Through analysis, it was identified that the customer's remittance to a sanctioned jurisdiction and their repeated inquiries about other sanctioned destinations are suspicious. The combination of transaction and behavior raises red flags.
Paragraph 4: Basis of Suspicion The connection between the remittance to a sanctioned jurisdiction and the customer's interest in other sanctioned destinations points to a potential layering and integration stage for potential money laundering or sanctions evasion. The customer's behavior also aligns with a potential proliferation financing typology, where funds may be disguised to support prohibited activities.
