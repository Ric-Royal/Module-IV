Paragraph 2: Suspicious Activity Description Activity: Numerous outgoing payments to individuals in countries with known high-risk for corruption and bribery. Dates of Activity: 2023-06-01 to 2023-06-30
Paragraph 3: Suspicious Activity A review of Green Earth Foundation's recent activities reveals a pattern of multiple outgoing payments to individuals in countries with a history of corruption and bribery. The transactions lack a clear business rationale and appear to be connected to high-risk jurisdictions.
Paragraph 4: Basis of Suspicion The consistent pattern of payments to individuals in high-risk jurisdictions without apparent business connections raises concerns of potential involvement in bribery or kickback schemes. The lack of legitimate business justification for these payments suggests a possible attempt to disguise illicit funds.
