Paragraph 2: Suspicious Activity Description A customer frequently visits the money remittance provider but only inquires about the process, fees, and available destinations for remittances. No actual remittance transactions are conducted.
Paragraph 3: Suspicious Activity Upon analysis, it becomes apparent that the customer's behavior is not consistent with normal transaction patterns. The repeated visits without any actual transactions raise suspicions.
Paragraph 4: Basis of Suspicion The customer's frequent inquiries about the remittance process without executing any actual transactions suggest potential reconnaissance or information gathering for illicit purposes. This aligns with a potential terrorism financing typology, where individuals gather information before executing a financial transaction related to terrorism.
