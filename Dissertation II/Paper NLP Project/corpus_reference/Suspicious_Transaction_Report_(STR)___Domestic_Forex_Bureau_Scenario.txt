Paragraph 2: Transaction Description A customer conducted a series of currency exchange transactions totaling $100,000 within a single day.
Paragraph 3: Suspicious Transaction Upon analysis, it was observed that the customer's transactions were significantly larger than their usual patterns. Additionally, the customer requested multiple exchanges of large-denomination bills, which is unusual.
